Documentation of the Final Project from the CWRU Cybersecurity course.

## Unit 24: Final Project README

### Unit Description

In this project, you will act as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts are working. 

If the alerts are working, you will then monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. Then, you will report back your findings to the manager with appropriate analysis.

### Lab Environment


<details><summary>Lab Details</summary>
<br>

In this unit, you will be using a new Web Vulns lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. RDP into the **Windows RDP host machine** using the following credentials:

  - Username: `azadmin`
  - Password: `p4ssw0rd*`

This is a diagram of the network and the machines that will be used in this lab:

Open the Hyper-V Manager to access the nested machines:

**ELK machine credentials:** The same ELK setup that you created in Project 1. It holds the Kibana dashboards.
- Username: `vagrant`
- Password: `vagrant`
- IP Address: `192.168.1.100`

**Kali:** A standard Kali Linux machine for use in the penetration test on Day 1. 
- Username: `root`
- Password: `toor`
- IP Address: `192.168.1.90`

**Capstone:** Filebeat and Metricbeat are installed and will forward logs to the ELK machine. 
- IP Address: `192.168.1.105`
   - Please note that this VM is in the network solely for the purpose of testing alerts.

**Target 1:** Exposes a vulnerable WordPress server.
- IP Address: `192.168.1.110`

**Target 2:** Students should ignore Target 2 until they have completed all other parts of the project.
